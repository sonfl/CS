1) How does the $\frac{1}{2}$ in $ J(\theta) = min_{\theta}\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^{2}$ affect the final result, since we put it there just to "make our calculations easier"?
</p>
Since later on we introduce $\alpha$ (which we choose whatever we want), we can observe that $\alpha_{1} = \alpha \frac{1}{2}$
